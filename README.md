[![Contributor-Covenant](https://img.shields.io/badge/Contributor%20Covenant-2.1-fbab2c.svg)](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)

## Overview

The **HAX (Human-Agent Experience) Interface** conforms to AGNTCY specs as described https://github.com/agntcy and builds upon the Outshift HAX project.

## **📌 About the Project**

This repository contains a **Human-Agent Experience (HAX) Interface**, designed to enhance collaboration between humans and AI agents within the AGNTCY framework.

This project is part of the [**AGNTCY**](https://docs.agntcy.org/pages/introduction.html) initiative — an open source collective building the infrastructure for the **Internet of Agents (IoA)**: a secure, interoperable layer for agent-to-agent collaboration across organizations and platforms.

The HAX Interface provides tools and guidelines for creating consistent, trusted, and scalable collaboration experiences. It focuses on enabling agents to control UI elements, proactively present information, and seamlessly involve humans in decision-making processes.

## Installation

## Architecture Overview

The HAX Interface architecture is designed to facilitate seamless human-agent collaboration. Key components include:

- **HAX SDK:** A schema-driven interface layer where agents send structured data to frontend components using a consistent format.
- **Reusable UI Components:** Pre-built components for common interaction patterns (e.g., confidence indicators, decision logs, action asks).
- **HAX Playbooks:** Pre-defined behavioral patterns for agents to follow in specific scenarios.
- **Looped-In-Human (LIH) Mechanisms:** Tools for agents to involve humans in decision-making when needed.
